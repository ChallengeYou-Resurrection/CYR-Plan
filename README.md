## Introduction <div id = "intro">
  ChallengeYou Resurrection (CYR) is a fan-made project creaed by people who loved ChallengeYou back in the day (2008-2009 times). The original game over on [ChallengeYou.com](challengeyou.com) does not work anymore on newer systems, and so we want to recreate the game so we can once again experience part of our childhoods.
  
## Languages <div id = "lang">
  CYR will be using multiple languages for the different aspects of the game.
